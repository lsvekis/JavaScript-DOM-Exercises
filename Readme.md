JavaScript DOM & Canvas Games — 100 Mini Projects (Vanilla JS)

A collection of 100 interactive mini-games, visual challenges, and DOM/Canvas exercises built with pure JavaScript — no frameworks, no libraries, no build tools.

This project is designed for:

Learners who want hands-on practice

Teachers looking for classroom-ready materials

Developers brushing up on JavaScript fundamentals

Anyone building a portfolio with real, interactive UI projects

Each exercise is fully self-contained and can be run directly in any browser.

🚀 Features

100+ interactive DOM & Canvas coding challenges

All projects built using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

Each exercise teaches a unique concept

Includes timers, animations, physics, drag & drop, audio, grids, randomization, and more

Beginner-friendly structure

Zero dependencies

Works offline

📦 Repository Structure

Depending on how you exported, this repo may be organized as:

Option A — Single Files per 10 Exercises
/dom_games_01_10/
/dom_games_11_20/
/dom_games_21_30/
...
/dom_games_91_100/


Each folder contains:

index.html
README.md (per set)

Option B — One-file-per-exercise Structure
/ex01/
/ex02/
/ex03/
...
/ex100/


Each exercise folder contains:

index.html
script.js (if split)
README.md (optional)

Option C — Mega Combined File
/all_100/
   index.html
   README.md


This is the single-file version containing all 100 games with a built-in mini test harness.

✔️ This README works for all structures.

🧠 Learning Outcomes

Across 100 exercises, learners will build real intuition for:

✔️ DOM Manipulation

Creating, removing, updating, and styling elements dynamically.

✔️ Events

Keydown, keyup, click, pointer, drag & drop, resize, input, timers.

✔️ Canvas 2D

Drawing shapes, particles, animations, collisions, charts.

✔️ Game Logic

State machines, difficulty scaling, win conditions, scoring systems.

✔️ Algorithms

Sorting, shuffling, reaction timing, minimax AI (Tic-Tac-Toe), path logic.

✔️ UI Programing

Grids, forms, color pickers, sliders, dynamic layouts.

✔️ Web APIs

Web Audio API, ResizeObserver, localStorage persistence.

This set is ideal for building a strong foundation in front-end development through interactive problem-solving.

▶️ How to Run

Simply open any index.html file in your browser:

No server required

No installation

Works offline

Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari compatible

🧪 Testing (when included)

Most sets include a Run All Tests button at the bottom.

This is a basic mini harness that checks if:

Elements load

Buttons trigger correctly

Canvases render

Game loops start

It’s not meant to validate deep logic — just to ensure no wiring is broken.
